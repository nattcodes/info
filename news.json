Let me assure all stakeholders in the education sector that the Federal government remains committed to the welfare of all staff and students. We shall continue to deal with the many contested issues in our various institutions within the limits of the resources available to the government. “On their parts, the university staff and other stakeholders need to appreciate the fact that our national economy, like the economies of most countries in the world, has not been in good shape since and even before the crippling of the COVID-19 pandemic, but my government’s commitment remains unshaken.”",

He hoped that the unions would explore other dispute resolution mechanisms when the need arose."
